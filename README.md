**Abstract:**<br>
This bachelor thesis deals with data optimization of a specific project of the logistic company DB Schenker, which is one of the world&apos;s leading providers in logistic services. The aim of the thesis is to find out whether the company is proceeding effectively in solving the logistics project. This means whether there is room for cost reduction in this project or not. Mixed integer linear programming is used for this purpose, namely a container transport problem and a container loading problem. The first part of the thesis is briefly described linear programming. Then transport problem, container transport problem and container loading problem are described in detail. This part of the thesis concludes with a description of modelling support system. The second part describes the company DB Schenker and the concept of its project, from which mathematical models are based on. Subsequently, the work is devoted to a modified container transport problem, including its achieved results. Furthermore, the work deals with a modified problem of container loading. Extensions of this model are discussed in detail here as well. Also, there is an analysis of the size of the model and its subsequent application to company data. All achieved results of the thesis were consulted with the company in the conclusion.
